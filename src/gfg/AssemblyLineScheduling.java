//        A car factory has two assembly lines, each with n stations.
//        A station is denoted by Si,j where i is either 1 or 2 and indicates the assembly line the station is on, and j indicates the number of the station.
//        The time taken per station is denoted by ai,j. Each station is dedicated to some sort of work like engine fitting, body fitting, painting and so on.
//        So, a car chassis must pass through each of the n stations in order before exiting the factory.
//        The parallel stations of the two assembly lines perform the same task.
//        After it passes through station Si,j, it will continue to station Si,j+1 unless it decides to transfer to the other line.
//        Continuing on the same line incurs no extra cost, but transferring from line i at station j â€“ 1 to station j on the other line takes time ti,j.
//        Each assembly line takes an entry time ei and exit time xi which may be different for the two lines.
//        Give an algorithm for computing the minimum time it will take to build a car chassis.
